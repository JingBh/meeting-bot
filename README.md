# meeting-bot

A **腾讯会议** bot, mainly for personal use.

## Requirements

 - `Node.js` >= 10
 - `Yarn` (recommended)
 - `Windows 10` with no GUI scale  
   (Because I didn't test this on other platforms.)
 - `腾讯会议` (the newer the better)

## How to run

Clone the repo and `yarn install`, then run the bot you need in the `bots` folder.
